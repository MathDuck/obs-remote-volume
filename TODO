* Cope with cropped scene elements?
* Respect the locked flag
  - Maintain a local locked flag if there's no upstream info
    - Default everything to unlocked, same as OBS itself does
  - Will need locked status to be transmitted, pref incl an event
    - See https://obsproject.com/mantis/view.php?id=1463
* Figure out why I lost my volume controls during gaming stream
  - Might be solved now that source types are sought synchronously
* Scale the volume sliders if the window isn't wide enough


To test a new build of OBS while live:
$ cd obs-studio/build

$ make -j6; make install
$ cd obs-websocket/build
$ rm -rf *; cmake -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/rosuav/obs-studio/libobs -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs ..
$ make -j6; make install
$ cd /home/rosuav/tmp/obs
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs/lib bin/obs
