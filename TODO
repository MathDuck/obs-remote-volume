* Cope with cropped scene elements?
* Figure out why I lost my volume controls during gaming stream
  - Might be solved now that source types are sought synchronously
* Scale the volume sliders if the window isn't wide enough
  - Probably not needed now that the status box isn't crashing into them?
* Respond to 'Exiting' event or socket disconnection by showing that we're
  currently disconnected, and allowing the user to reconnect. Won't be perfect
  (it's possible to lose traffic transfer without a disconnection signal), but
  would be better than pretending all's fine but having no socket.
* Respond to SourceMuteStateChanged and SourceVolumeChanged
  - Note that they both loop back, which is convenient for the former, but may
    be a pain for the latter.
    - May be best to update volume only if it's been X milliseconds since the
      last change that we sent???
* Have a (one-shot? toggled?) way to grab an image from every source in the
  scene, thus giving a viable preview, not just a wireframe


To test a new build of OBS while live:
$ cd obs-studio/build
$ rm -rf *; cmake -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs ..
$ make -j6; make install
$ cd obs-websocket/build
$ rm -rf *; cmake -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/rosuav/obs-studio/libobs -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs ..
$ make -j6; make install
$ cd /home/rosuav/tmp/obs
