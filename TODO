* Respect gravity
  - it's the law!
* Cope with cropped scene elements?
* Respect the locked flag
  - Maintain a local locked flag if there's no upstream info
    - Default everything to unlocked, same as OBS itself does
  - Locked items can be neither sized nor moved
  - Locked items have a paler background, of a different hue
  - Locked items get U+1F512 LOCK "ðŸ”’" in the top left corner.
* Move scene item buttons out of the Layout Management details
* Figure out why I lost my volume controls during gaming stream
  - Might be solved now that source types are sought synchronously
