* Cope with cropped scene elements?
* Respect the locked flag
  - Maintain a local locked flag if there's no upstream info
    - Default everything to unlocked, same as OBS itself does
  - Will need locked status to be transmitted, pref incl an event
    - See https://obsproject.com/mantis/view.php?id=1463
* Figure out why I lost my volume controls during gaming stream
  - Might be solved now that source types are sought synchronously
* Scale the volume sliders if the window isn't wide enough
* Respond to 'Exiting' event or socket disconnection by showing that we're
  currently disconnected, and allowing the user to reconnect. Won't be perfect
  (it's possible to lose traffic transfer without a disconnection signal), but
  would be better than pretending all's fine but having no socket.
