* Cope with cropped scene elements?
  - It's possible to "crop" in the transform, or "crop/pad" as a filter, or add
    "crop" attributes to certain source types (incl window capture). Test all.
* Figure out why I lost my volume controls during gaming stream
  - Might be solved now that source types are sought synchronously
* Scale the volume sliders if the window isn't wide enough
  - Probably not needed now that the status box isn't crashing into them?
* Respond to SourceVolumeChanged
  - Note that it loops back, which may be a pain.
    - May be best to update volume only if it's been X milliseconds since the
      last change that we sent???
  - Would need help from upstream regarding mute status - currently it's not
    being sent. Consider using full:true for this as well? See PR:
    https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/pull/324#issuecomment-513176003
* Have a (one-shot? toggled?) way to grab an image from every source in the
  scene, thus giving a viable preview, not just a wireframe
  - Possibly problematic. Check the code comment re crashing OBS.
  - Needs upstream support and investigation.


To test a new build of OBS while live:
$ cd obs-studio/build
$ rm -rf *; cmake -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs ..
$ make -j6 && make install
$ cd obs-websocket/build
$ rm -rf *; cmake -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/rosuav/obs-studio/libobs -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs ..
$ make -j6 && make install
$ cd /home/rosuav/tmp/obs
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/rosuav/tmp/obs/lib bin/obs
